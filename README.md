# Yoshi Duels Cover Pack

This folder contains all covers used for my videos, you can use them as textures for your game.
This has been organised by Yu-gi-oh series. If a legacy character appears in a series, its cover will be in the folder of their original series.
(Ex: Kaito is in the ZEXAL folder and not the ARC-V folder)

#### How to use

 - Before any manipulation, I strongly advise to go into your ygopro textures folder and copy the cover and cover2 files somewhere else. If you don't, you won't be able to change your cover, should you change your mind.
  - Rename the cover file you want to use as "cover" and the cover file you want your opponent to use as "cover2".
  - Copy those files to your ygopro texture folder, replacing any old one.
